<!-- teaser-begin -->

*prometheus-async* adds support for asynchronous frameworks to the official [Python client](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python) for the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics and monitoring system.

Currently [*asyncio*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) and [Twisted](https://twisted.org) are supported.

It works by wrapping the metrics from the official client:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import web
from prometheus_client import Histogram
from prometheus_async.aio import time

REQ_TIME = Histogram("req_time_seconds", "time spent in requests")

@time(REQ_TIME)
async def req(request):
      await asyncio.sleep(1)
      return web.Response(body=b"hello")
```


Even for *synchronous* applications, the metrics exposure methods can be useful since they are more powerful than the one shipped with the official client.
For that, helper functions have been added that run them in separate threads (*asyncio*-only).

The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/hynek/prometheus-async) and the documentation on [Read The Docs](https://prometheus-async.readthedocs.io/).
