# Changelog

Versions follow [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org) with a strict backwards-compatibility policy.

The **first number** of the version is the year.
The **second number** is incremented with each release, starting at 1 for each year.
The **third number** is when we need to start branches for older releases (only for emergencies).

You shouldn't ever be afraid to upgrade *prometheus-async* if you're using its public APIs and pay attention to `DeprecationWarning`s.
Whenever there is a need to break compatibility, it is announced here in the changelog and raises a `DeprecationWarning` for a year (if possible) before it's finally really broken.

<!-- changelog follows -->

## 19.2.0 (2019-01-17)

### Backward-incompatible changes:

*none*

### Deprecations:

*none*

### Changes:

-   Revert the switch to decorator.py since it turned out to be a very breaking change. Please note that the now current release of wrapt 1.11.0 has a [memory leak](https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt/issues/128) so you should block it in your lockfile.

    Sorry for the inconvenience that has been caused!

## 19.1.0 (2019-01-15)

### Backward-incompatible changes:

*none*

### Deprecations:

*none*

### Changes:

-   Dropped most dependencies and switched to decorator.py to avoid a C dependency (wrapt) that produces functions that can't be pickled.

---

## 18.4.0 (2018-12-07)

### Backward-incompatible changes:

-   `prometheus_client` 0.0.18 or newer is now required.

### Deprecations:

*none*

## 18.3.0 (2018-06-21)

### Backward-incompatible changes:

*none*

### Deprecations:

*none*

### Changes:

-   The HTTP access log when using `prometheus_async.start_http_server()` is disabled now. It was activated accidentally when moving to `aiohttp`'s application runner APIs.

---

## 18.2.0 (2018-05-29)

### Backward-incompatible changes:

*none*

### Deprecations:

-   Passing a *loop* argument to `prometheus_async.aio.start_http_server()` is a no-op and raises a `DeprecationWarning` now.

### Changes:

-   Port to `aiohttp`'s application runner APIs to avoid those pesky deprecation warnings. As a consequence, the *loop* argument has been removed from internal APIs and became a no-op in public APIs.

---

## 18.1.0 (2018-02-15)

### Backward-incompatible changes:

-   Python 3.4 is no longer supported.
-   `aiohttp` 3.0 or later is now required for aio metrics exposure.

### Deprecations:

*none*

### Changes:

-   `python-consul` is no longer required for asyncio Consul service discovery. A plain `aiohttp` is enough now.

---

## 17.5.0 (2017-10-30)

### Backward-incompatible changes:

-   `prometheus_async.aio.web` now requires `aiohttp` 2.0 or later.

-   Fixed compatibility with `aiohttp` 2.3.

---

## 17.4.0 (2017-08-14)

---

## 17.3.0 (2017-06-01)

### Backward-incompatible changes:

*none*

### Deprecations:

*none*

### Changes:

-   `prometheus_async.aio.web.start_http_server()` now passes the *loop* argument to `aiohttp.web.Application.make_handler()` instead of `Application`'s initializer. This fixes a "loop argument is deprecated" warning.

---

## 17.2.0 (2017-03-21)

### Deprecations:

-   Using `aiohttp` older than 0.21 is now deprecated.

### Changes:
